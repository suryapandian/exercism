What Is OOP?

Object oriented programming roughly refers to programming languages that have a number of iconic features:

    Encapsulation - Associating data and functions into the conceptual unit of a single type called an object.
    Abstraction - Hiding data and function members to obfuscate implementation details of an object.
    Polymorphism - The ability to interacting with an object from different functional perspectives.
    Inheritance - The ability to inherit data and behavior from other objects.
